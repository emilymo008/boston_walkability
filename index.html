    <h3 style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; text-align: center">
        When a city has more resources available within a distance that's neither too convenient nor too far away, its people are able to access their everyday needs while getting in some physical activity on the side. Research consistently shows that walkable cities are <a href= "http://americawalks.org/learning-center/benefits-of-walking-2/health/">healthier</a> and can increase one's sense of <a href = "https://www.citylab.com/design/2014/12/growing-evidence-shows-walkability-is-good-for-you-and-for-cities/383612/">connectedness with one's community</a>. <br/><br/>

I decided to rephrase walkability as a proportion of the city's total geographical area: how much of Boston's space is within 1 mile of open spaces or public library branches?</h3> <!-- when things are too close, it provides convenience and safety, esp w/i schools. when things are a moderate distance away, they allow us to get some physical activity on the way to them without being too great of an inconvenience. If they are too far away, they may become less safe or easy to access, and we gain none of the above benefits.-->

        For many lucky Boston Public Schools students, the benefits of a play space or a quality library are accessible right within their schools. However, when these resources are not available within school grounds, how much can students benefit from a walk to these resources in the neighborhood surrounding their schools?</h3>

So, despite the fact that many Boston public schools lack on-site recreational spaces, the vast majority of these schools are just a short walk away from a public recreational space.<br><br></p> <!-- MENTION SAFETY, younger children accessibility-->

            <h3 align="center">Walkability to Libraries from Boston Public Schools</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left; margin-left:5%; margin-right: 5%; line-height: 1.3;">71% of Boston Public Schools (91 schools) are located within 1 mile of a Boston Public Library branch. <br><br>
            At the time of the 2016 inspections, 83% of Boston public schools (107 schools) had media centers that were rated "Deficient" or "Poor, and 16% (20 schools) had media centers that were rated "Fair", "Good", or "Excellent". Two of the schools had no media centers.

Even when schools have access to media and recreational resources on-site, walkability can provide students with more options and exposure to different parts of the community, especially for students who do not have access to a car or who live in areas where public transportation is limited. <br><br>

Both the 1-mile walkability rate from Boston public schools to open spaces and the 1-mile walkability rate from Boston public schools to public libraries exceed their respective rates for the city of Boston overall.<br><br>

Still, the lack of adequate play spaces or media centers in schools themseves remains an issue because...<br><br>
<li>Many guardians' schedules do not allow them to accompany their children who are too young to walk alone.</li>
<li>Some neighborhoods are safer for children to walk in than others.</li>
<li>For students who are disabled, walking to resources even within a one-mile radius may not be a feasible option.</li>

<br>

In a healthier Boston, resources like parks and libraries would be walkable from all schools, but such resources would also be integrated into their learning environments. In the planning process for new spaces that allow for recreation or educational aid, proximity to public schools which lack such facilities should be a top priority.
